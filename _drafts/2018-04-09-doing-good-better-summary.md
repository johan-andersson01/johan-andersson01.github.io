# Distilled notes on Doing Good Better

When trying to improve the world, one should not solely focus on doing. One should also focus on doing where it matters most. This is the main theme in William MacAskill's book [Doing Good Better](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/doing-good-better/).

This blog post is not an attempt at introducing the concept of [Effective altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism) (EA), but rather an attempt at summarizing the contents of Doing Good Better. Summarizing this info will surely give a newcomer a sense of what EA is, but the primary goal of this write-up is to strengthen knowledge in people already familiar with the concept. It is thus not aimed to be some sort of introduction to EA, of which there are already a plenty (including this book).

In short, this is for those who can't find the time, but naturally it is hard to accurately comprise a 200-page book into one blog post.

## Good intentions do not necessitate good effects

In 1995 the [PlayPump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundabout_PlayPump) had its first installment. It was a a water pump designed for kids who would spin it around and have fun, while simultaneously pumping up water from the ground. It was a **good intention**, that would later be shown to have negative effects.

The project received endorsements from numerous influential people:

- Steve Case (then CEO of AOL)
- Jay-Z (Hip-hop artist)
- Bill Clinton (former president of the U.S.)
- Laura Bush (former first lady of the U.S.)

In 2008, PlayPumps' founder said:

> "It really rocks me to know we’re making a difference to a lot of people who are nowhere near as privileged as I am or my family is"

 By 2009, eight hundred PlayPumps had been installed across a couple of southen African countries. It was then discovered that the PlayPump was not any fun at all. While most merry-go-rounds have sufficiently low friction to spin freely after some applied force, the PlayPump needed constant force in order to pump water, making the playing children exhausted and probably not too entertained.

> "Much of the time, women of the village ended up pushing the merry-go-round themselves—a task they found tiring, undignified, and demeaning."

> A woman in Mozambique said, “From five A.M., we are in the fields, working for six hours. Then we come to this pump and have to turn it. From this, your arms start to hurt. The old hand pump was much easier.”

> One reporter estimated that, in order to provide a typical village’s water needs, the merry-go-round would have to spin for twenty-seven hours per day.

Not only did the pumps prove a hurtful replacement to the old hand pumps, but it turned out that no one had even asked the affected communities whether they wanted a PlayPump in the first place.

And to top it all of, the PlayPump:

- often broke down in a couple of months
- was difficult to repair (and getting maintenance support was difficult)
- cost four times as much as a hand pump.

Thus, even while the idea of the PlayPump had good intentions, it turned out to be a net-negative experience for the affected parties.

[Watch the Frontline/World episode 'Troubled Water' (2010) describing the issues of the PlayPump here](http://www.pbs.org/video/frontlineworld-troubled-water/). Start at the 3 minute mark to skip the intro. Note the good intentions.

### The lesson

Don't evaluate a charity by judging its intentions; evaluate it by judging its effects.

## How much can you do?

Even though your country may be divided in wealth distribution and you may feel poor in comparison to the richest of the rich, you are in all likelihood in the top from a global perspective.

- income above $52K/year: top 1%
- income above $28K/year: top 5%
- income above $11K/year: top 15%

Doubling a person's income will increase the subjective well-being by the same amount, regardless of the income size.

## Weighing suffering

It is hard to compare different sorts of suffering. To help, we can try to quantitize suffering and use a metric to compare different sorts of suffering, in order to evaluate where the need for support is greatest.

One such metric is [QUALY (quality-adjusted life years)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year). Using such metrics help us in deciding who we should help. For example: should we donate $4000 to a guide dog training charity in order to train one guide dog for one person suffering of blindness, or should we donate $4000 to a charity fighting [trachoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trachoma) and cure hundreds of blindness? In which scenario do we gain the most QUALYs for our buck?

## If you don't want to fight on the front lines

 You don't have to join Doctors Without Borders. You don't have to volunteer in poor, remote villages. You don't have to give up your privileged urban life in order to help people.

Instead, you can save people and make a real difference by donating some of your income to effective charities (i.e. not PlayPump). If you're a student, try donating 1% of your income. If you're working, see if you can donate somewhere up to 10% of your income.

The cost of saving a life in the developing world is about $3400 (this pays for 560 mosquito nets which on average saves 1 person from dying in malaria). If you earn $28K a year and donate 10% of your earnings, you would **save a life** every 440 days. In your lifetime of, say, 40 working years you would then save approximately 33 lives. That's amazing! (but remember! you have to donate effectively for this rough estimate  to hold)

## Why you shouldn't donate to disaster relief

Consider two "recent" disasters:

- Earthquake in Fukushima, Japan (2011)

    - Millions of people left without electricy or water
    - 15,000 dead

- Earthquake in Haiti (2010)

    - 280.000 buildings collapsed
    - Cholera broke out
    - 150,000 died

In both cases there was massive global media coverage and large humanitarian relief efforts. In each case the international aid raised amounted to about $5 billion.

Even though Japan is thirty times richer than Haiti (per capita) and even though 150,000 people died in Haiti (vs 15,000 in Japan), the raised international aid resulted in rougly the same amount. 

If the global community had been rational, we would not have given Japan as much as we had given Haiti, it being a poorer country and much more affected.

It seems that donors don't particularly care about differences in scale and severity of disasters. Instead it seems that people donate to widely publicized disasters. (A 2008 earthquake in China that killed 87,000 people only received $500 million in donations - probably due to its lesser media coverage)

> Funding seems to be allocated in proportion with how evocative and widely publicized the disaster is, rather than on the basis of its scale and severity.

## What if you chose a career that makes a lot of money

See [80,000 Hours' piece on this](https://80000hours.org/articles/earning-to-give/). 

TL;DR: find a high paying job you like in order to give and help more.

## Confusions in regards to charity evaluation

You should not care about how much the CEO is payed or how much overhead a charity has. These are redundant variables that can trick you in evaluating effectiveness. The most important thing you need to ask is: how much good does this charity accomplish for every dollar I give it?

MacAskill lists 5 questions he thinks any donor should ask before deciding where to donate:

- What does this charity do? 
- How cost-effective is the charity?
- How robust is the supporting evidence?
- How well is each program implemented?
- Does the charity need additional funds?


## Which causes are most important?

In order to assess which area we should consider, we should try to prioritze causes which have as many of the following characteristics as possible:

- Large problem magnitude
- The cause is neglected
- The cause is tractable

Unattributed quotes are cited directly from the book (version 1).

While I do provide some URLs to external sources, these are additional reading. Doing Good Better has been the sole source used while writing this.

Do not count on this to be an accurate summary.

- I have probably cherry picked content. 
- I have probably injected my own thoughts/writings.
