In the process of writing an image-to-image translation GAN, you can produce some pretty neat art. Below are samples from 10 epochs of training on the horse2zebra dataset, with a generator of 3 convolutional and 1 bilinear upsampling layers and a discriminator with 1 convolutional layer. (Obviously a very weak architecture, but good enough for debugging)
